# Simple Linear Regression Project

# Overview
This project implements **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** to predict salary based on years of experience. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between two variables.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization
- Model saving and loading



# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains:

- **Independent Variable (X)** → Years of Experience  
- **Dependent Variable (Y)** → Salary  

Dataset File:
- `Salary_Data.csv`



# 🧠 Algorithm Used
Simple Linear Regression is used to find the relationship between two variables using the equation:
